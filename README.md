DESCRIPTION

Preliminary tool for generating SII EEPROM binary for ESC according to ETG.2010 from an ESI compliant XML (ETG.2000)

Can also decode an already existing EEPROM and (hopefully) print the contents in a human readable manner.

Outputting OpenEtherCAT Society Slave Stack (SOES) compatible object dictionary and ESC configuration files is also a goal.
